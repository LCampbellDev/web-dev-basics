            <h2><i>Tips and free resources you can use to build your skills</i></h2>
            <h3>Why learn web development?</h3>
            <p>Why not! There are so many transferrable skills to be learnt from coding, from problem solving to resilience, to keeping brain working and healthy by forming new neural pathways, to actually becoming a web developer or software engineer. So, give it a go and see if you enjoy it.</p>
            <!--Can't remember 100% what span does but am using it so these quotes can stand out from the main text/paragraphs.  think it does that!-->
            <span>"Coding is a great hobby, I love how I can dom it anytime, on my own and get that dopamine hit from building something tangible."</span>
            <h3>What exactly is web development?</h3>
            <p>Web development foundations most commonly involve: <!--add unordered list ul-->
                <ul>
                    <li>In a nutshell, <strong>building websites.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>HTML</strong>- the strucure and layout of the page (remember early 90s websites? these were built with html only).</li>
                    <li><strong>CSS</strong> - This adds extra styling to make websites more visually appealing.</li>
                    <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> for adding fancy interactive things like animations, dark mode, and visual changes that happen when you hover your mouse or click in certain areas of the page.</li>></JavaScript>
                </ul>
                <p>There are other ways to build websites, however for a beginner this is the simplest way to get started.</p>
                <p>The coding knowledge and skills you develop in HTML, CSS and JavaScript for web development can be used specific to that role, or be a good foundation to build on with further programming and software engineering skills.</p>
                <span>"I've met and made friends with people I otherwise wouldn't have got to know through attending local coding meetups.  This has also been a great way to get feedback and mentoring and to find open source projects to get involved in."</span>
                <h3>Where to start learning coding?</h3>
                <h2><i>And for free!</i></h2>
                <p>Here are my recommendations. They are free at the time of writing this and I will only recommend resources I have tried.</p>p>
                <!--was going to insert ordered list, but have decided to insert a table so I can put 
                -column 1: the title/name of resource, and hyperlink
                -column 2: details/review
                -column 3: the link hyperlinked so can be copy and pasted or clicked-->

                <!!--need to look up documentation on tables for reminder. Will include:
                1. Code Institute 5 fay web dev challenge src=https://codeinstitute.net/5-day-coding-challenge/
                2. W3schools tutorials - link to html, CSS< JS tutorials - perhaps that could be ordered list within the table cell
                3.freecodecamp
                4.Codecademy free courses (some courses and career pathways paid)
                5.Traversy media youtube

<!--add sentence re representation then free resources and networks Coding Black Females and Code First girls. And ABC? 100devs-Leon Noel.  Maybe with subheadings so can have the link, the description and who it's for eg. women and non-binary people / underepresentend genders / People of COlour / Women of Colour / if ABC - need to checkout Autistic Black Coders/ OR alternatively include in the table above with a note.  If separate consider calling the above table 'Free resources for all'-->
            </p>

            <p>If you get hooked and want to build your skills further you may wish to try a taught course or bootcamp.  I've definitely gained a lot from luve teaching, group work and one to one mentoring. I'd say it has sped up my progress and helped me learn and practice skills that are necessary for working as a developer, but not possible on your own when doing self-directed learning.</p>

<!--This above is coded from recall (initial version). 

Then, whilst adding content, I looked up documentation on:
-span briefly after writing it
-whether h tags should go inside paragraphs, which they don't so my initial code was correct
-unordered lists, I could remember ul, but not how to separate the items with li-->

<!--Debugging:
Will aim to code with 3 screens in future so can have warp, vscode and the live browser view open. As coded this with 2 screens and checked live browser view after. Will commit then make changes.
-->

<!--
Need to look at documentation next re:
meta data
linking to css and js files

Future lookup re:
Adding sections
image sizing - pixels and responsive
accessibility features / syntax in html and css

Things I hadn't considered or come up in debugging or code review:
